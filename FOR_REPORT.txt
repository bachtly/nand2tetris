Project 1: Draw truth-tables
Project 2: 
	_ Output of FullAdder carry is OR
	_ ALU is just bunch of if else (remember internal bus)
Project 3:
a	_ Bit uses DFF to use the sequential -> register uses 8 Bits
	_ PC has if-else hierachy (the higher if will be the lower code in hdl)
	_ RAM access address, but how ? ? ? -> Base on their order.
b	_ Base on first 3 bits to MUX and DEMUX 8 smaller RAM
Project 4:
	_ Fill will be used to interview
Project 5:
	_ Memory
	_ CPU
	_ Computer
Project 6: 
	_ Nothing to do
